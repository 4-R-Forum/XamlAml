XamlAml is a tool to help engineers get their work done with Aras Innovator(R). It takes advantage of existing powerful open source tools and the Windows OS. It is built with declarative code Xaml and AML, Powershell scripts and OpenXML (the second x in xslx.) All the code is accessible, nothing is compiled except the IOM SDK, so you are free to adapt and extend for whatever you need to do.

ExceLoader imports data in an Excel workbook directly to Innovator, it is intended for moderate amounts of data.

ExcelReport creates an Excel workbook directly from data in Innovator, which may include charts, pivot tables or whatever.
